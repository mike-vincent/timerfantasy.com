SUBTITLE (30 chars max):
Analog Timers for Your Mac

DESCRIPTION:
Timer Fantasy brings the elegance of analog timers to your Mac. Set timers with a simple drag on a beautiful clock face, and watch time count down in a way that's intuitive and satisfying.

FEATURES

Multiple Timer Scales
Choose from 16 different clock faces ranging from 5 minutes to 96 hours. The clock face automatically adapts to show time in a way that makes sense—a 5-minute timer shows a 5-minute scale, while an 8-hour timer shows hours.

Auto Zoom
Let the app automatically choose the best clock face for your timer. As time counts down, it can zoom in to show more detail.

Run Multiple Timers
Create as many timers as you need. Each timer runs independently with its own settings, colors, and alarm sounds.

Customize Everything
- Pick from 15 built-in macOS alarm sounds
- Set alarm duration from 1 to 60 seconds
- Choose your own timer colors or use auto-color
- Loop timers to repeat automatically
- Name your timers for easy identification

End At Mode
Instead of setting a duration, set when you want the timer to end. Perfect for "remind me at 3pm" scenarios.

iCloud Sync
Your timers sync across all your Macs automatically.

Clean Design
A minimal, dark interface that looks great on your desktop without being distracting. The analog clock face gives you an instant sense of how much time remains at a glance.
